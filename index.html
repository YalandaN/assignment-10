<h1>Room + Garden Studio Project</h1>

<p><b>Project Length:</b> Approx. 3 Weeks</p>

  <p>Room + Garden is a studio project based on my favorite book. The book I decided on was Americanah, a novel written by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Americanah tells the story of a young Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, who immigrates to the United States to attend university. Although the story is nonfiction, the characters and storylines involved are quite relatable to real stories.  The novel tackles concepts of immigration, love, education, race and racism.</p>

  <p>For this project, we were to take inspiration from our book of choice and construct a model that reflect three distinctive spaces in the model. The three spaces are described as a <b>1)</b> an open space (<em>the garden</em>),<b> 2)</b> a confined space (<em>the gatekeeper</em>) and <b>3)</b> a space in between (<em>the reading room</em>).</p>
